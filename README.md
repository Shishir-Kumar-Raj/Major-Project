# An Automated Deep Learning Model for Detecting Image Forgeries
This project identifies manipulated images by applying Error Level Analysis (ELA) to expose altered areas and utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate between authentic and fake images. Techniques like data augmentation, early stopping, and evaluation through accuracy and confusion matrices are used to enhance and assess the model's performance.
